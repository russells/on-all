 Workstation lists are in /usr/local/etc/on-all-workstations
 Workstation list defaults to /usr/local/etc/on-all-workstations/all
 "-- command" must be supplied
 Workstations can be specified as:
   inside a file specified with -W
   non-option arguments before the -- separator

 Uses ssh, so if you have passwordless ssh logins for the right user, no
 typing of passwords will be required.

 BEWARE OF SHELL QUOTING IN YOUR COMMANDS.

 Examples:

  Run the hostname command on every workstation in your 'all' list:
    on-all-workstations -- hostname

  Install the foo package on two workstations:
    on-all-workstations -u root wa-aifs-ws01 wa-aifs-ws02 -- yum install -y foo

  Reboot all workstations in the RFC:
    on-all-workstations -u root -W rfc -- shutdown -r now

  Remove TIFS keys from all except the TIFS workstations:
    on-all-workstations -u root -N tifs-keys -- yum erase -y TIFS-SSHKeys

  Look for all aifs-gfe-client* packages on the RFC workstations:
  The \| makes the pipe and grep run on the remote workstation, not locally:
    on-all-workstations -u root -W rfc -- rpm -qa \| grep aifs-gfe-client

  List the mozilla files and directories in /tmp:
  The \* makes the wildcard expand on the remote workstation, not locally:
    on-all-workstations -u root -- ls -ld /tmp/mozilla\*
